within the monit check process for xl2tpd, we can connect to control socket
and test status, but we can't send messages if the status is incorrect

or we can "check network ppp0"
  start program = "ifup ppp-l2tp blah"
  if failed link then restart

with enough retries inside the xl2tpd config I think that will suffice
