# Contributing

[ This is a placeholder, because it's early days and the volume of contributions thus far can be counted in an eggcup ]

* Contributions are very welcome

* Please open an issue (or otherwise establish some kind of dialogue) before you send a PR I haven't asked for.  
Just so I know it's expected and you're not wasting time doing something I won't accept or have already started on 

* The Nix code in NixWRT is MIT-licenced (same as Nixpkgs), but the code it combines from other places (e.g. Linux, OpenWRT) may 
have a variety of licences.  I have no intention of asking for copyright assignment: just like when submitting to the
Linux kernel you retain the copyright on the code you contribute.

* Please govern yourself in NixWRT project venues according to the guidance in the [geekfeminism "Community Anti-harassment Policy"](https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Community_anti-harassment/Policy).

* If you've read the preceding bullets and don't find anything to disagree with, open a PR
